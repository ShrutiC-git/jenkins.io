  This is an introductory blog to the new CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins, developed as a GSoC'21 project. In this blog, we will be looking at how the integration between Jenkins and CloudEvents makes working across a suite of CI/CD tools easier. CloudEvents is the industry-adopted specification for describing events, and with the release of this plugin, Jenkins is now CloudEvents-compliant.

== The What, Why and How of Interoperability

With workloads and teams becoming more diverse and complex, there is an increasing need to automate various tasks in the CI/CD ecosystem of an application as a way to decrease complexity that comes with CI/CD. A more diverse team working across different aspects of the application requires a diverse suite of CI/CD tools too, to test and deliver to a wide range of users. More often than not, we need these tools to work together and exchange data to form an effective CI/CD pipeline. However, chaining multiple services together can very easily increase complexity.

How? Each of these services use a different "language" to communicate and represent the entity(event) which occured inside that service. In order for another service to understand this "language", the service might need to develop customized clients and agents which specialises in understanding, traversing and taking-actions based on what was transmitted to it by the first service. One can think of it as a translator who specialises in a language called ABC, and each service who wants to communicate with the service who uses ABC will have to employ this translator, or perhpas get another trained translator. And there would be no guarantee that this translator will also help talk with other services who might be speaking a completely different language.

We can see how easily that can grow in cost and maintenance. A preferred way is to have a common language each of these services use and understand as a way to communicate amongst each other. This way, an event which is emitted using this common language will be available to any of the interested receiver without that receiver needing a special agent. This way of communicating using a common/standard language also increases agnostic communication where the sender or the receiver are sending and receiving data without creating a tight coupling between the two. 

CloudEvents specification is enabling that loosely-coupled, event-driven communication between services by enforcing that common language for how an event should be emitted and transferred.

  A specification for describing event data in a common way

____
* Consistency
    - Consistent across tools and services. 
* Accessibility
    - Common event format means no common libraries, tooling, and infrastructure for delivering event data across environments. 
* Portability
    - Easily port event-data across tools.

The CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins is developed as an effort to make interoperability between Jenkins and CI/CD tools much easier. The CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins is a GSoC project, and with efforts from an amazong team of mentors, this project is aimed at enhancing event-driven interoperability between cloud-native CI/CD tools, making it easier for developers to include jenkins in their CI/CD pipelines.

With this plugin, Jenkins can send and receive CloudEvents-compliant events to and from a wide variety of CI/CD tools using CloudEvents as their event format. This plugin makes chaining Jenkins with multiple tools like Tekton, Keptn, Knative and more, very easy. 


== GSoC Phase 1 - CloudEvents Plugin

=== Using CloudEvents plugin for Jenkins

This plugin allows Jenkins to be configured as a source and sink, which can emit and consume CloudEvents from a range of tools simultaneously. 

==== Jenkins as a Source
Configuring Jenkins as a Source enables Jenkins to send CloudEvents to a CloudEvents sinks. For Phase-I of this project, there is support for HTTP Sinks, however CloudEvents supports various link:https://github.com/cloudevents/spec#cloudevents-documents[protocol bindings]. Moving forward, there will also be support for other protocol bindings supported by CloudEvents. 


To use Jenkins as a Source, the following configuration is needed:

1. Click on *Manage Jenkins* in the Root-Actions menu on the left.

2. Inside the Manage Jenkins UI, search for *Configure System* under *System Configuration*.
image:https://github.com/ShrutiC-git/cloudevents-plugin/blob/main/public/configure_system.png[Configure System]

3. In the *Configure System* UI, sroll down to the CloudEvents plugin section, and this is where all the plugin configuration will be present. Here, you will have to enter the following information:

* Sink Type (For now, HTTP Protocol Binding for CloudEvent and HTTP Sink is supported.)
* Sink URL (URL of the Sink where you want the cloudevents sent.)
* Events you want sent to the CloudEvents
image:https://github.com/ShrutiC-git/cloudevents-plugin/blob/main/public/sinkType.png[Configure Sink to Receive Events]

With Jenkins as a Source configured, Jenkins will send a POST request to the configured sink right as the selected event happens inside Jenkins. Each event has different data specific to the type of the event that is emitted. 



==== Event Types, Payload and Metadata

CloudEvents emitted by Jenkins follow the Binary-structure supported by CloudEvents, where the CloudEvents metadata is present inside the header, and the event-data is serialized as JSON, and present under request-body. This is the HTTP Protocol Binding for CloudEvents. Each protocl binding for CloudEvents follows definition specific to the binding protocol. 

For now, the following Jenkins events are supported in the CloudEvents Plugin-Jenkins as a Source: 

* link:https://github.com/ShrutiC-git/cloudevents-plugin#queue-events[**Queue Events**]
** Queue Entered Waiting
** Queue Left 
* link:https://github.com/ShrutiC-git/cloudevents-plugin#build-events[**Build Events**]
** Job Started
** Job Completed
** Job Finalized
** Job Failed
* link:https://github.com/ShrutiC-git/cloudevents-plugin#job-events[**Job Events**]
** Job Created
** Job Updated
* link:https://github.com/ShrutiC-git/cloudevents-plugin#job-events[**Node Events**]
** Node Online
** Node Offline

Following is a table of the queue-entered waiting cloudevents metadata:

|===
|Event Metadata Headers Key|Event Metadata Headers Value

|ce-specversion
|1.0

|ce-type
|org.jenkinsci.queue.entered_waiting

|ce-source
|job/test

|ce-id
|123-456-789
|===

__All of these fields will be present inside the HTTP-request headers since the CloudEvents format used here is the Binary structure.__ 


Here's also an example of event payload for the queue-entered 

```
{
  "ciUrl": "http://3.101.116.80/",
  "displayName": "test2",
  "entryTime": 1626611053609,
  "exitTime": null,
  "startedBy": "shruti chaturvedi",
  "jenkinsQueueId": 25,
  "status": "ENTERED_WAITING",
  "duration": 0,
  "queueCauses": [
    {
    "reasonForWaiting": "In the quiet period. Expires in 0 ms",
    "type": "entered_waiting"
    }
  ]
}

```

== Try the Plugin

The plugin will soon be releasing as the CloudEvents Plugin under  link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[]!!

Here's the GitHub Repo of the Plugin: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/cloudevents-plugin[CloudEvents Plugin GitHub Repo]

== Demo

Here is a video of the CloudEvents plugin with SockEye demoed at CDF GSoC Midterm Demos. link:https://github.com/n3wscott/sockeye[SockEye] is an open-source tool which is designed as a way to visulaize cloudevents which are sent from a sink. In this demo, we will take a look at how Jenkins installed in a multi-node K8s environment work with the CloudEvents plugin as a Source, sending events over HTTP to the SockEye sink.

=== Next Steps

- Jenkins as a Sink to allow Jenkins to trigger various actions as cloudevents are received from other tools. 
- Enabling filtering on CloudEvents metadata to only act upon a certain kind of events recieved.


=== Feedback

We would absolutely love to hear your suggestions and feedback. This will help us understand the various use-cases for the plugin, and iterate to support a variety of bindings and formats.

Feel free to log an issue at the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/cloudevents-plugin[CloudEvents Plugin GitHub] repository. We are on CDF slack under `gsoc-2021-jenkins-cloudevents-plugin`.
